The rice variety classification dataset encompasses a comprehensive collection of images representing five distinct rice varieties: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag. Each of these rice varieties is meticulously curated, with 15,000 images dedicated to capturing the unique visual characteristics and features associated with each variety. These images serve as invaluable resources for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance rice cultivation, variety identification, and agricultural practices through the application of deep learning and computer vision techniques.

Stored in JPEG format, the dataset comprises images standardized to a resolution of 250x250 pixels, with three color channels (RGB). This standardization ensures consistency in representation across the dataset, facilitating seamless integration into machine learning pipelines and model training workflows. By providing a diverse and extensive collection of images for each rice variety, the dataset enables thorough exploration and analysis of the distinct traits and attributes that differentiate one variety from another.
